Lab Exercise
==========================

The primary goal of this lab period is to get your C compiler up and running.

We have 2 "Hello, World!" examples for you to practice compiling to make sure that everything is working.

Lab 1 files (ZIP) (This ZIP file contains: 3 .c files and 1 .h file.)

**Compile hello1 with:**

*gcc hello.c -o hello1*

**Compile hello2 with:**

*gcc main.c hello.c -o hello2*
